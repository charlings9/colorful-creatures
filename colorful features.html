        <p>The <em>Domestic Dog</em> is a beautiful pet I love because <strong>they are
            the domesticated descendant of the wolf.</strong>. <br>
            Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from the extinct Pleistocene wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. <br>
            Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture I found it very amazing and entertaining during my last visit to a Game Park in Lagos Nigeria.
